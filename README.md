# ASG1 Creating a Website with HTML, CSS, JS
  For this website, I based it on a (trading) card game reseller. It aims to provide another source that trading card players can buy from. I created this website as there is a rise in trading card games especially "Pokemon TCG" in the previous years. By having another website that potential buyers or people who are new to the scene can buy from, it will increase the popularity of trading card games in the future.

  As a user, I would want to be able to easily view the products that are available so that I can check if there are things that I am looking for.

These are the wireframes I made

For the main page, I created my own logo using Illustrator, and i used <a> tag to create words and photos that are  responsive with the users. I used a button tag to create the "Shop" which has a radial gradient around it after doing some research.
  
Firstly, the logo would bring users back to the main page, the image that says "CARD GAMES RESELLER" would bring it to the company's mission and vision, these are all made with the attribute tag to give the users some interaction with the website itself.
  
Secondly, there is a photo of the Trending products which displays a photo from the Pokemon trading card game. This photo is also made interactive with the <a> tag and would bring users to the Shop page, underneath the photo are photos 
 
Firstly, I made texts and images that are interactive with the users using the attribute tag (<a>). 
  
Secondly, I made the <a> tags link to respective webpages.
  
Thirdly, I did a footer on every single page (except for the Cart page) that links to various part of the website and also social media platforms, by using flex and @media to make it responsive for mobile users.
  
On the About us page, I used position for my images to make them responsive.

I included a Logo on every page which brings users back to the main page.
  
I made a basic but not functioning log in/sign up form and tried to use js but failed, I also included display, flex into this webpage of the code.
  
I made a different main page after signing in to let users know that they have already signed in after signing in, this page can also allow users to sign out
  
I made a cart webpage where users can type their orders into a form which then will be submitted to me in an email.

For the Shop webpage I tried to make a responsive webpage where mobile users can also use this without having any difficulty, by doing so, I used display: flex; and align-items, justify-content as well as box-shadow to make the webpage look more lively.
  
I also tried to make the header sticky so that the navigation bar would follow the users as they scroll down.
  
I added some features such as hovering and active for the navigation bar
  
I added more effects of box-shadow when users hover their cursor above the selected items.
  
I also included js into this webpage which allowed me to try to make responsive texts and navigation bars to the side of the webpage for mobile users to interact with.
